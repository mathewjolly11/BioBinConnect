================================================================================
                    CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES TO FIX
================================================================================

🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - SECURITY

1. SECRET_KEY EXPOSED IN SETTINGS.PY
   Location: MyProject/settings.py (line 40)
   Issue: Secret key is hardcoded and visible
   Risk: Security vulnerability if code is shared/deployed
   
   FIX:
   - Move to .env file:
     SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   - Update settings.py:
     SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'fallback-key-for-dev')

2. DEBUG MODE ENABLED
   Location: MyProject/settings.py (line 43)
   Issue: DEBUG = True (should be False in production)
   Risk: Exposes sensitive error information
   
   FIX:
   - Move to .env file:
     DEBUG=False
   - Update settings.py:
     DEBUG = os.environ.get('DEBUG', 'False') == 'True'

3. EMPTY ALLOWED_HOSTS
   Location: MyProject/settings.py (line 45)
   Issue: ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] (allows all hosts in DEBUG mode)
   Risk: Security vulnerability in production
   
   FIX:
   - Add to .env file:
     ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,yourdomain.com
   - Update settings.py:
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = os.environ.get('ALLOWED_HOSTS', 'localhost').split(',')

4. DATABASE PASSWORD EMPTY
   Location: MyProject/settings.py (line 103)
   Issue: 'PASSWORD': '' (no database password)
   Risk: Database security vulnerability
   
   FIX:
   - Set MySQL password
   - Move to .env file:
     DB_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
   - Update settings.py:
     'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('DB_PASSWORD', '')

================================================================================
                    MISSING FEATURES & ENHANCEMENTS
================================================================================

🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - FUNCTIONALITY

1. NO AUTOMATED COLLECTOR ASSIGNMENT FOR FARMER ORDERS
   Current: Admin manually assigns collectors to farmer waste orders
   Impact: Time-consuming, prone to errors
   
   SUGGESTION:
   - Auto-assign collector with most available inventory
   - Consider proximity to farmer (future: GPS integration)
   - Implement in: MyApp/sales_views.py

2. NO AUTOMATIC PAYMENT REMINDERS
   Current: Households must remember to pay monthly
   Impact: Late payments, manual follow-up needed
   
   SUGGESTION:
   - Scheduled task to send payment reminders
   - Email 3 days before due date
   - Implement using Django Celery or cron jobs

3. NO INVENTORY LOW STOCK ALERTS
   Current: Manual checking of inventory levels
   Impact: May run out of stock unexpectedly
   
   SUGGESTION:
   - Email alerts when inventory < threshold (50kg)
   - Dashboard warnings for collectors
   - Implement in: CollectorApp/views.py

4. NO EXPIRY WARNINGS FOR WASTE
   Current: Waste auto-expires after 30 days
   Impact: Collectors may not know waste is about to expire
   
   SUGGESTION:
   - Email alerts 7 days before expiry
   - Dashboard notifications
   - Implement in: utils/email_utils.py

5. NO ROUTE OPTIMIZATION
   Current: Collectors manually plan routes
   Impact: Inefficient collection, wasted time/fuel
   
   SUGGESTION:
   - Implement route planning algorithm
   - Sort pickups by house number
   - Future: GPS-based optimization

6. NO RATING/FEEDBACK SYSTEM
   Current: No way to rate collectors, managers, or products
   Impact: No quality control mechanism
   
   SUGGESTION:
   - Add rating system (1-5 stars)
   - Feedback comments
   - Display average ratings

7. NO REPORTING/ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
   Current: Basic reports exist but limited
   Impact: Hard to track trends and performance
   
   SUGGESTION:
   - Charts for waste collection trends
   - Revenue vs expenses graphs
   - User growth metrics
   - Export to PDF/Excel

8. NO MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS TESTING
   Current: Unknown mobile compatibility
   Impact: Poor user experience on mobile devices
   
   SUGGESTION:
   - Test all pages on mobile devices
   - Add responsive CSS media queries
   - Consider Progressive Web App (PWA)

9. NO BACKUP/RESTORE FUNCTIONALITY
   Current: Manual database backups only
   Impact: Risk of data loss
   
   SUGGESTION:
   - Automated daily database backups
   - Backup to cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Drive)
   - Restore functionality

10. NO AUDIT TRAIL FOR ADMIN ACTIONS
    Current: Admin actions not logged
    Impact: No accountability for changes
    
    SUGGESTION:
    - Log all admin actions (approvals, assignments, payments)
    - Create tbl_AuditLog table
    - Display in admin dashboard
